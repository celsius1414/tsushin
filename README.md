# tsushin (通信)
Übersicht widget : Dynamically updating line chart that shows total up and down data being transferred to your Mac in kB. Heavily inspired by the work of Dion Munk -  network-throughput

## How to use:
Just copy tsushin.widget folder to your Widgets Folder. _Please let me know if you get error that says .bash_profile does not exists._

## How to read the graph:
Yellow line indicates the total amount of uploaded data at the given time.
Blue line then is for the total of downloaded data at the given time.

## Note:
This should work out of box just by placing tsushin.widget folder in your Widgets Folder. However if you entcounter any error, please let me know.

Happy coding
