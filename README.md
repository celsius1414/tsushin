Ãœbersicht widget : Dynamically updating line chart that shows total up and down data being transferred to your Mac in kB. Heavily inspired by the work of Dion Munk -  network-throughput

Note:
Somce commands were not being loaded correctly as this widghet requires some bash commands. To get around this issue, I have created a .bash_profile with the default paths that comes with most of recent Mac OS Xs that have the commands used for this widget. Please download the current version if it was not working for previously. The current one should work for most of the setup even if you don't have .bash_profile unless you have removed bash 3.2 that ships with Mac
